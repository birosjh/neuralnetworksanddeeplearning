# Simple Neural Network

This code is based on the code from the Neural Networks and Deep Learning book.
The code from the book is originally written in Python 2, but my version is written using 3.

I have also refactored several parts of the original code for my own practice and understanding.

### Simple Way to Run It

In the terminal, startup ipython.  Then just run this line.

    `%run run.py`

If you want to try different network sizes, or activation functions you can change the run.py file
or run all the lines directly in ipython.
